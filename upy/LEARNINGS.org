#+TITLE: Learnings so far re micropython

First: It's the easy way, though the hard way (C) isn't that hard.

Second: The easy way is full of potholes.

 - RP2 Timer() API is only superficially similar to the rest of uPy.

 - Many many standard libraries are not available, including some that
   just seem like they must have been "too much trouble" like functools.

Upshot: Use uPy to sort out bit-twiddling procedures, but ignore its
higher-level APIs in favor of just writing stuff in C. The SDK seems to
be better documented there too.
